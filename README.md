The first model to beat 100% of ChatGPT-3.5 
Available on Huggingface

🔥 OpenChat_8192 
🔥 105.7% of ChatGPT (Vicuna GPT-4 Benchmark)

Less than a month ago the world witnessed as ORCA [1] became the first model to ever outpace ChatGPT on Vicuna's benchmark.

Today, the race to replicate these results open-source comes to an end.

Minutes ago OpenChat scored 105.7% of ChatGPT.

But wait! There is more!

Not only OpenChat beated Vicuna's benchmark, it did so pulling off a LIMA [2] move!

Training was done using 6K GPT-4 conversations out of the ~90K ShareGPT conversations.

The model comes in three versions: the basic OpenChat model, OpenChat-8192 and OpenCoderPlus (Code generation: 102.5% ChatGPT)

This is a significant achievement considering that it's the first (released) open-source model to surpass the Vicuna benchmark. 🎉🎉

[2] - LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment - TL;DR: Using small number of VERY high quality samples (1000 in the paper) can be as powerful as much larger datasets: https://lnkd.in/dFNv5zaV
